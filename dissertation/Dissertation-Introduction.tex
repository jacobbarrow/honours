\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Outline}
The project will consist of a range of deliverables and milestones.
 
\paragraph{Background Research}
A literature review will be undertaken to provide context to the project and define its scope

\paragraph{Data collection}
In order to provide the algorithm with articles to classify, a dataset is required. It will be sourced from a range of publishers, and ideally cover a large timescale to allow trends to be identified.

\paragraph{Data Labelling}
A raw dataset can be made more valuable by creating a training set from it. This will be a small subsection of the articles that volunteers will label with their perception of the incongruence.

\paragraph{Algorithm Creation}
Once a dataset is generated and labelled, the algorithm to classify the articles can be implemented. 

\paragraph{Analysis}
The algorithm will create a range of datapoints that can be analysed. Trends will be spotted in the dataset used, and comparisons made with different implementations of the algorithm.

\paragraph{Discussion}
