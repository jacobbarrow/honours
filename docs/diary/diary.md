# Project Diary

## Week 2 (17/09/20)

### Meeting notes
This first meeting was a group meeting, so only covered the more general admin side of the project - we went over the basic structure it could take, some of the ways of keeping on track and managing time, and loosley covered the development cycle of iteration and testing. 

## Week 3 (23/09/20)

### Progress since last meeting
I had created a rough draft of the IPO, and made a kanban board on Github to sketch out the project. I had also done some initial reading around fake news and the importance of headline.

### Meeting notes
This was the first one-on-one meeting initially to cover the basics of the project. We talked about some next steps, including making a Gantt chart, getting the dissertation template set up with relevant headings and maybe looking in to either sourcing a dataset or creating my own. 

I also got more of an idea over how to go about implementing the algorithm, and initally I'm feeling more drawn to a natural language processing approach as opposed to a machine learning one - it won't necessarily require a labelled dataset, and could be quite effective at detecting incongruence. Of course, I'll need to do more reading around this to settle on a specific approach.
