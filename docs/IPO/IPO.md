# Initial Project Overview

## Overview of project content and milestones
The aim of the project is to create and evaluate a method of determining if the headline of a news article appropriately reflects its content. 

The project will have several milestones. Firstly, a literature review will be undertaken that both analyses existing solutions, as well as exploring the problem space more generally. Then a prototype solution will be created, after which it will be tested and refined. Finally, the results and effiacy of the solution will be analysed and conclusions drawn.

## The main deliverable(s)
The most important deliverable of this project will be an algorithm that is able to determine to what percentage a headline matches the content of an article.

## The target audience for the deliverable(s)
?? people in the field of sentiment analysis, news agencies, people who want to determine the trustworthyness(?) of the info they're reading 

## The work to be undertaken
- data will need to be either collected and labelled, or an existing dataset found
- the algorithm will need to be created


## Additional information/knowledge required
I'm currently unsure how to approach the algorithm design and implementation of this project. I have a very rudimentary understanding of neural networks and sentiment analysis, so research will need to be conducted into these areas, and a decision made whether to use one or the other, a combination of both or something else entirely.
